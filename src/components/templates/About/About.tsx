            <AboutDescription>
              Since the beginning of 2019 I have had a connection with the IT industry.
              I have been striving to develop my skills every day through numerous training courses as well as by completing a great deal of projects.
              Iâ€™m in my element while using JavaScript in conjunction with React and other libraries.
              Towards the end of 2021 I also decided to learn the language of Solidity and therefore enrolled for the course.
